Enter the IPSec groupname in the Group Name field and the new IKE key value
in the New Key field. Reenter the new key for confirmation in the Confirm Key
field. If the values in the New Key and Confirm Key field are not the same,
Cisco SDM prompts you to reenter the key values. The Current Key field displays asterisks (*) if there is a current IKE key value. This field is blank if no key has been configured. User Authentication
If the Easy VPN server or concentrator has been configured to use XAuth, it
requires a username and password whenever the router establishes the connection,
including when you deliver the configuration to the router, and when you
disconnect and reconnect the tunnel. Find out whether XAuth is used, and obtain
the required username and password. If the server allows passwords to be saved, you can eliminate the need to enter the
username and password each time the Easy VPN tunnel is established. The
information is saved in the router configuration file and used each time the tunnel
is established. Choose one of these ways to enter the XAuth username and password:
Manually in a web browser window (cid:127)
The web browser option appears only if supported by the Cisco IOS Note
image on your router. Manually from the command line or Cisco SDM (cid:127)
Automatically by saving the username and password on the router (cid:127)
The Easy VPN server may use XAuth to authenticate the router. If the server
allows passwords to be saved, you can eliminate the need to enter the
username and password each time the Easy VPN tunnel is established by this
option. Enter the username and password provided by the Easy VPN server
administrator, and then reenter the password to confirm its accuracy. The Current Password field displays asterisks (*) if there is a current Note
password value. This field is blank if no password has been configured. Cisco Router and Security Device Manager 2.4 User’s Guide

The information is saved in the router configuration file and used each time
the tunnel is established. Storing the XAuth username and password in router memory creates a security Caution
risk because anyone who has access to the router configuration can obtain this
information. If you do not want this information stored on the router, do not enter
it here. The Easy VPN server will simply challenge the router for the username
and password each time the connection is established. Also, Cisco SDM cannot
itself determine whether the server allows passwords to be saved. You must
determine whether the server allows this option. If the server does not allow
passwords to be saved, you should not create a security risk by entering the
information here. Add or Edit Easy VPN Remote: Interfaces and Connections
In this window you can set the inside and outside interfaces, and specify how the
tunnel is brought up. Inside Interfaces
Choose the inside (LAN) interface to associate with this Easy VPN configuration. You can choose multiple inside interfaces, with the following restrictions:
If you choose interfaces that are already used in another Easy VPN (cid:127)
configuration, you are notified that an interface cannot be part of two Easy
VPN configurations. If you choose interfaces that are already used in a standard VPN (cid:127)
configuration, you are notified that the Easy VPN configuration you are
creating cannot coexist with the existing VPN configuration. Cisco SDM will
ask if you want to remove the existing VPN tunnels from those interfaces and
apply the Easy VPN configuration to them. An existing interface does not appear in the list of interfaces if it cannot be (cid:127)
used in an Easy VPN configuration. For example, loopback interfaces
configured on the router do not appear in this list. An interface cannot be designated as both an inside and an outside interface. (cid:127)

The Easy VPN Server feature introduces server support for the Cisco VPN Client
Release 3.x and later software clients and Cisco VPN hardware clients. The
feature allows a remote end user to communicate using IP Security (IPSec) with
any Cisco IOS Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway. Centrally managed IPSec
policies are “pushed” to the client by the server, minimizing configuration by the
end user. The following link provides general information on the Cisco Easy VPN solution,

Open Firewall
Open Firewall
This screen is displayed when Cisco SDM detects firewall(s) on interfaces that
would block return traffic that the router needs to receive. Two situations in which
it might appear are when a firewall will block DNS traffic or PKI traffic and
prevent the router from receiving this traffic from the servers. Cisco SDM can
modify these firewalls so that the servers can communicate with the router. Modify Firewall
This area lists the exit interfaces and ACL names, and allows you to select which
firewalls that you want Cisco SDM to modify. Select the firewalls that you want
Cisco SDM to modify in the Action column. Cisco SDM will modify them to allow
SCEP or DNS traffic from the server to the router. Note the following for SCEP traffic:
Cisco SDM will not modify firewall for CRL/OCSP servers if these are not (cid:127)
explicitly configured on the router. To permit communication with
CRL/OCSP servers, obtain the correct information from the CA server
administrator and modify the firewallsusing the Edit Firewall Policy/ACL
window. Cisco SDM assumes that the traffic sent from the CA server to the router will (cid:127)
enter through the same interfaces through which traffic from the router to the
CA server was sent. If you think that the return traffic from CA server will
enter the router through a different interface than the one Cisco SDM lists,
you need to open the firewall using the Edit Firewall Policy/ACL window. This may occur if asymmetric routing is used, whereby traffic from the router
to the CA server exits the router through one interface and return traffic enters
the router through a different interface. Cisco SDM determines the exit interfaces of the router the moment the (cid:127)
passthrough ACE is added. If a dynamic routing protocol is used to learn
routes to the CA server and if a route changes—the exit interface changes for
SCEP traffic destined for the CA server—you must explicitly add a
passthrough ACE for those interfaces using the Edit Firewall Policy/ACL
window. Cisco SDM adds passthrough ACEs for SCEP traffic. It does not add (cid:127)

in Prerequisite Tasks for PKI Configurations. Create Certificate Authority (CA) Server
Click this button to create a CA server on the router. Because only one CA server
can be configured on the router, this button is disabled if a CA server is already
configured. The CA server you configure using SDM allows you to grant and revoke Note
certificates. Although the router does store the serial numbers and other
identifying information about the certificates that it grants, it does not store the
certificates themselves. The CA server should be configured with a URL to a
Registration Authority (RA) server that can store certificates that the CA server
grants. Restore Certificate Authority (CA) Server
If a CA server already operates on the router, you can restore the CA server
configuration, and the information. If no CA server is configured on the router,
this option is disabled. Prerequisite Tasks for PKI Configurations
Before you begin a certificate enrollment or CA server configuration, it may be
necessary for you to complete supporting configuration tasks first. SDM reviews
the running configuration before allowing you to begin, alerts you to
configurations you must complete, and provides links that take you to the areas of
SDM that allow you to complete these configurations. SDM may generate alerts about the following configuration tasks:
SSH credentials not verified—Cisco SDM requires you to provide your SSH (cid:127)
credentials before beginning. NTP not configured—The router must have accurate time for certificate (cid:127)
enrollment to work. Identifying a Network Time Protocol server from which

DNS not configured—Specifying DNS servers helps ensure that the router is (cid:127)
able to contact the certificate server. DNS configuration is required to contact
the CA server and any other server related to certificate enrollment such as

impact on the Cisco IOS router hosting the CA server. If the checking device
cannot connect to the CDP, as a backup it will use SCEP to fetch the CRL from

The CA server uses public and private RSA keys to encrypt data and to sign
certificates. SDM automatically generates a new key pair and gives it the name of
the CA server. You can change the key modulus and type, and you can make the
key exportable. You must enter a passphrase to use when restoring the CA server. Label
This field is read-only. SDM uses the name of the CA server as the name of the
key pair. Modulus
Enter the key modulus value. If you want a modulus value between 512 and 1024
enter an integer value that is a multiple of 64. If you want a value higher than
1024, you can enter 1536 or 2048. If you enter a value greater than 512, key
generation may take a minute or longer. The modulus determines the size of the key. The larger the modulus, the more
secure the key, but keys with large modulus take longer to generate, and
encryption/decryption operations take longer with larger keys. Type
By default, Cisco SDM creates a general purpose key pair that is used for both
encryption and signature. If you want Cisco SDM to generate separate key pairs

Cisco IOS SSL VPN
Cisco IOS SSL VPN provides Secure Socket Layer (SSL) VPN remote-access
connectivity from almost any Internet-enabled location using only a web browser
and its native SSL encryption. This enables companies to extend their secure
enterprise networks to any authorized user by providing remote-access
connectivity to corporate resources from any Internet-enabled location. Cisco IOS SSL VPN also enables access from noncorporate-owned machines,
including home computers, Internet kiosks, and wireless hotspots, where an IT
department cannot easily deploy and manage the VPN client software necessary
for IPsec VPN connections. There are three modes of SSL VPN access: clientless, thin-client and full-tunnel
client. Cisco SDM supports all three. Each mode is described below:
Clientless SSL VPN—Clientless mode provides secure access to private web (cid:127)
resources and will provide access to web content. This mode is useful for
accessing most content that you would expect to use within a web browser,
such as intranet access, and online tools that employ a web interface. Thin Client SSL VPN (port-forwarding Java applet)—Thin Client mode (cid:127)
extends the capability of the cryptographic functions of the web browser to
enable remote access to TCP-based applications such as POP3, SMTP, IMAP,
Telnet, and SSH. Full Tunnel Client SSL VPN—Full tunnel client mode offers extensive (cid:127)
application support through its dynamically downloaded SSL VPN client
software for Cisco IOS SSL VPN. With the Full tunnel Client for Cisco IOS
SSL VPN, we delivers a lightweight, centrally configured and
easy-to-support SSL VPN tunneling client that allows network layer
connectivity access to virtually any application. Cisco Router and Security Device Manager 2.4 User’s Guide

or more security protocols to be used for authentication, thus ensuring a backup
system for authentication in case the initial method fails. Cisco IOS software uses the first listed method to authenticate users. If that
method fails to respond, the Cisco IOS software selects the next authentication
method listed in the method list. This process continues until there is successful
communication with a listed authentication method, or all methods defined in the
method list are exhausted. It is important to note that the Cisco IOS software attempts authentication with
the next listed authentication method only when there is no response from the
previous method. If authentication fails at any point in this cycle—meaning that
the security server or local username database responds by denying the user
access—the authentication process stops and no other authentication methods are

immediately after configuring your WAN connection. When you complete the configuration changes in SDP, you must return to (cid:127)
Cisco SDM and click Refresh on the toolbar to view the status of the
trustpoint in the Router Certificates window in the VPN Components tree. Troubleshooting Tips
These recommendations involve preparations on the local router and on the CA
server. You need to communicate these requirements to the administrator of the
CA server. Ensure the following:
The local router and the CA server have IP connectivity between each other. (cid:127)
The local router must be able to ping the certificate server successfully, and
the certificate server must be able to successfully ping the local router. The CA server administrator uses a web browser that supports JavaScript. (cid:127)
The CA server administrator has enable privileges on the local router. (cid:127)
The firewall on the local router will permit traffic to and from the certificate (cid:127)
server. If a firewall is configured on the Petitioner and/or on the Registrar, you must (cid:127)
ensure that the Firewall permits HTTP or HTTPS traffic from the PC from
which the Cisco SDM /SDP application is invoked. For more information about SDP, see the following web page:

Cisco Common Classification Policy
Language
Cisco Common Classification Policy Language (C3PL) is a structured
replacement for feature-specific configuration commands. C3PL allows you to
create traffic policies based on events, conditions, and actions. SDM uses C3PL
to create the policy maps and class maps that the following help topics describe. Policy Map
Policy maps specify the actions to be taken when traffic matches defined criteria. Traffic types and criteria are defined in class maps associated with a policy map. In order for a router to use the information in a policy map and its associated class
maps, the policy map must be associated with a zone-pair. See Zone-Based Policy
Firewall for more information on configuring zones and zone pairs. Policy Map Windows
Use the policy map windows to review, create and edit policy maps for QoS,
HTTP, and other types of traffic. The top portion of the window lists the
configured policy maps, and the bottom portion displays the details of the

Application inspection policies are applied at Layer 7 of the OSI model, where
user applications send and receive messages that allow the applications to offer
useful capabilities. Some applications might offer undesired or vulnerable
capabilities, so the messages associated with these capabilities must be filtered to
limit activities on the application services. Cisco IOS Software Zone-Policy Firewall offers application inspection and

Click to highlight the traffic flow that enters the router on the To interface and
exits the router on the From interface. When this area is highlighted, you can see
the details of rules applied to returning traffic. Icons
Rules are represented by icons in the traffic flow:
A filter symbol indicates that an access rule is being applied. A magnifying glass indicates that an inspection rule is being applied. A firewall icon in the router indicates that a firewall has been applied to
the Originating traffic flow. Cisco SDM displays a firewall icon if the
following sets of criteria are met:
There is an inspection rule applied to Originating traffic on the (cid:127)
inbound direction of the From interface, and there is an access rule
applied to the inbound direction of the To interface. The access rule on the inbound direction of the To interface is an (cid:127)
extended access rule, and contains at least one access rule entry. No firewall icon is displayed when a firewall has been applied to

Rules applied to Originating traffic are indicated by a right arrow. An
icon on the From interface traffic line indicates the presence of a rule
filtering traffic inbound to the router. An icon placed on the To interface
traffic line indicates a rule filtering traffic outbound from the router. If
you place the mouse over this icon, Cisco SDM will display the names
of the rules that have been applied. Rules applied to Returning traffic are indicated by a left arrow. An icon
on the To interface traffic line indicates the presence of a rule filtering
traffic inbound to the router. An icon on the From interface traffic line
indicates the presence of a rule filtering traffic outbound from the router. The names of the rules applied are displayed when you place the cursor
over this icon. Although the icons are shown on a particular interface in the diagram, a firewall Note
policy might contain access control entries that affect traffic not represented by
the diagram. For example, an entry that contains the wildcard icon in the
Destination column (see Make Changes to Access Rules) might apply to traffic
exiting interfaces other than the one represented by the currently chosen To
interface. The wildcard icon appears as an asterisk and stands for any network or
host. To make changes to an access rule, see Make Changes to Access Rules. To return

Application Security
Application Security allows you to create security policies to govern the use of
network and web applications. You can apply the policies that you create to
specific interfaces, clone an existing policy to leverage the settings for a new
policy, and remove policies from the router. The Application Security feature, also referred to as Application Firewall was
first supported in Cisco IOS 12.4(15)T4, and Cisco Router and Security Device
Manager (Cisco SDM) 2.2. New releases of Cisco SDM are backwards
compatible with all previously-supported versions of Cisco IOS. If you are using
a more recent version of Cisco SDM and the user interface described in this
chapter does not appear in the Cisco SDM application, the router may use a more
recent Cisco IOS release. This chapter contains the following sections:

IM applications are able to communicate over nonnative protocol ports, such Note (cid:127)
as HTTP, and through their native TCP and UDP ports. Cisco SDM
configures block and permit actions based on the native port for the
application, and always blocks communication conducted over HTTP ports. Some IM applications, such as MSN Messenger 7.0, use HTTP ports by (cid:127)
default. To permit these applications, configure the IM application to use its
native port. Peer-to-Peer Applications

Server Information
The information entered in this window identifies the Easy VPN tunnel, the Easy
VPN server or concentrator that the router will connect to, and the way you want
traffic to be routed in the VPN. Connection Name
Enter the name that you want to give this Easy VPN connection. The name must
be unique among Easy VPN tunnel names for this router and must not contain
spaces or special characters such as question marks (?). Easy VPN Servers
You can enter information for a primary and a secondary Easy VPN server. Easy VPN Server 1
Enter the IP address or the hostname of the primary Easy VPN server or
concentrator to which the router will connect. If you enter a hostname, there must
be a Domain Name System(DNS) server on the network that can resolve the
hostname to the correct IP address for the peer device. Easy VPN Server 2
The Easy VPN Server 2 field appears when the Cisco IOS image on the router
supports Easy VPN Remote Phase III. This field does not appear when the Cisco
IOS image does not support Easy VPN Remote Phase III. Enter the IP address or the hostname of the secondary Easy VPN server or
concentrator to which the router will connect. If you enter a hostname, there must
be a DNS server on the network that can resolve the hostname to the correct IP
address for the peer device. Mode of Operation

Client Choose if you want the PCs and other devices on the router’s inside
networks to form a private network with private IP addresses. Network Address
Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT) will be used. Devices
outside the LAN will not be able to ping devices on the LAN, or reach them
directly. Network Extension Choose if you want the devices connected to the inside
interfaces to have IP addresses that are routable and reachable by the destination
network. The devices at both ends of the connection will form one logical
network. PAT will be automatically disabled, allowing the PCs and hosts at both
ends of the connection to have direct access to one another. Consult with the administrator of the Easy VPN server or concentrator before
choosing this setting. If you choose Network Extension, you can enable remote management of the
router by checking the box to request a server-assigned IP address for your router. This IP address can be used for connecting to your router for remote management
and troubleshooting (ping, Telnet, and Secure Shell). This mode is known as
Network Extension Plus. If the router is not running a Cisco IOS image that supports Easy VPN Remote Note
Phase IV or later, you will not be able to set Network Extension Plus. Authentication
Use this window to specify security for the Easy VPN Remote tunnel. Device Authentication
Choose Digital Certificates or Preshared Key. The Digital Certificates option is available only if supported by the Cisco IOS Note

Enter the IPSec group key. The group key must match the group key defined on
the VPN concentrator or server. Obtain this information from your network
administrator. Reenter the key to confirm its accuracy. User Authentication (XAuth)
User authentication (XAuth) appears in this window if the Cisco IOS image on
the router supports Easy VPN Remote Phase III. If user authentication does not
appear, it must be set from the router command-line interface. Choose one of these ways to enter the XAuth username and password:
Manually in a web browser window (cid:127)
The web browser option appears only if supported by the Cisco IOS Note
image on your router. Manually from the command line or Cisco SDM (cid:127)
Automatically by saving the username and password on the router (cid:127)
The Easy VPN server may use XAuth to authenticate the router. If the server
allows the save password option, you can eliminate the need to enter the
username and password each time the Easy VPN tunnel is established by this
option. Enter the username and password provided by the Easy VPN server
administrator, and then reenter the password to confirm its accuracy. The
information is saved in the router configuration file and used each time the
tunnel is established. Storing the XAuth username and password in router memory creates a security Caution
risk, because anyone who has access to the router configuration can obtain this
information. If you do not want this information stored on the router, do not enter
it here. The Easy VPN server will simply challenge the router for the username
and password each time the connection is established. Additionally, Cisco SDM
cannot itself determine whether the Easy VPN server allows the save password
option. You must determine whether the server allows this option. If the server
does not allow this option, you should not create a security risk by entering the
information here. Cisco Router and Security Device Manager 2.4 User’s Guide

Enter New PIN
Enter a new PIN for the USB token. The new PIN must be at least 4 digits long
and must match the name of the token you want to log in to. If you are editing a
USB token login, the current PIN will be replaced by the new PIN. Reenter New PIN
Reenter the new PIN to confirm it. Maximum PIN Retries
Choose the maximum number of times Cisco SDM will attempt to log in to the
USB token with the given PIN. If Cisco SDM is unsuccessful after trying for the
number specified, it will stop trying to log in to the USB token. Removal Timeout
Enter the maximum number of seconds that Cisco SDM will continue to use
Internet Key Exchange (IKE) credentials obtained from the USB token after the
token is removed from the router. The number of seconds must be in the range 0
to 480. If you do not enter a number, the default timeout is used. The default timeout is
triggered when a new attempt to access the IKE credentials is made. Secondary Config File
Specify a configuration file that exists on the USB token. The file can be a partial
or complete configuration file. The file extension must .cfg. If Cisco SDM can log in to the USB token, it will merge the specified
configuration file with the router’s running configuration. Cisco Router and Security Device Manager 2.4 User’s Guide

Open Firewall
Open Firewall
This screen is displayed when Cisco SDM detects firewall(s) on interfaces that
would block return traffic that the router needs to receive. Two situations in which
it might appear are when a firewall will block DNS traffic or PKI traffic and
prevent the router from receiving this traffic from the servers. Cisco SDM can
modify these firewalls so that the servers can communicate with the router. Modify Firewall
This area lists the exit interfaces and ACL names, and allows you to select which
firewalls that you want Cisco SDM to modify. Select the firewalls that you want
Cisco SDM to modify in the Action column. Cisco SDM will modify them to allow
SCEP or DNS traffic from the server to the router. Note the following for SCEP traffic:
Cisco SDM will not modify firewall for CRL/OCSP servers if these are not (cid:127)
explicitly configured on the router. To permit communication with
CRL/OCSP servers, obtain the correct information from the CA server
administrator and modify the firewallsusing the Edit Firewall Policy/ACL
window. Cisco SDM assumes that the traffic sent from the CA server to the router will (cid:127)
enter through the same interfaces through which traffic from the router to the
CA server was sent. If you think that the return traffic from CA server will
enter the router through a different interface than the one Cisco SDM lists,
you need to open the firewall using the Edit Firewall Policy/ACL window. This may occur if asymmetric routing is used, whereby traffic from the router
to the CA server exits the router through one interface and return traffic enters
the router through a different interface. Cisco SDM determines the exit interfaces of the router the moment the (cid:127)
passthrough ACE is added. If a dynamic routing protocol is used to learn
routes to the CA server and if a route changes—the exit interface changes for
SCEP traffic destined for the CA server—you must explicitly add a
passthrough ACE for those interfaces using the Edit Firewall Policy/ACL
window. Cisco SDM adds passthrough ACEs for SCEP traffic. It does not add (cid:127)
passthrough ACEs for revocation traffic such as CRL traffic and OCSP
traffic. You must explicitly add passthrough ACEs for this traffic using the
Edit Firewall Policy/ACL window. Cisco Router and Security Device Manager 2.4 User’s Guide

Certificate Authority Server
You can configure a Cisco IOS router to serve as a Certificate Authority (CA)
server. A CA server handles certificate enrollment requests from clients, and can
issue and revoke digital certificates. Configure > VPN > Public To create, back up, restore, or edit a CA server, go to
Key Infrastructure > Certificate Authority > Create CA Server. Configure > VPN > Public To manage certificates on an existing CA server, go to
Key Infrastructure > Certificate Authority > Manage CA Server. Monitor > VPN Status > CA Server. To monitor a CA server, go to
Create CA Server
This window allows you to launch a wizard for creating a Certificate Authority
(CA) server, or a wizard for restoring a CA server. Only one CA server can be set
up on a Cisco IOS router. The CA server should be used to issue certificates to hosts on the private network
so that they can use the certificates to authenticate themselves to other
Prerequisite Tasks
If Cisco SDM finds that there are configuration tasks that should be performed
before you begin configuring the CA server, it alerts you to them in this box. A
link is provided next to the alert text so that you can go to that part of Cisco SDM

and complete the configuration. If Cisco SDM does not discover missing
configurations, this box does not appear. Possible prerequisite tasks are described
in Prerequisite Tasks for PKI Configurations. Create Certificate Authority (CA) Server
Click this button to create a CA server on the router. Because only one CA server
can be configured on the router, this button is disabled if a CA server is already
configured. The CA server you configure using SDM allows you to grant and revoke Note
certificates. Although the router does store the serial numbers and other
identifying information about the certificates that it grants, it does not store the
certificates themselves. The CA server should be configured with a URL to a
Registration Authority (RA) server that can store certificates that the CA server
grants. Restore Certificate Authority (CA) Server
If a CA server already operates on the router, you can restore the CA server
configuration, and the information. If no CA server is configured on the router,
this option is disabled. Prerequisite Tasks for PKI Configurations
Before you begin a certificate enrollment or CA server configuration, it may be
necessary for you to complete supporting configuration tasks first. SDM reviews
the running configuration before allowing you to begin, alerts you to
configurations you must complete, and provides links that take you to the areas of
SDM that allow you to complete these configurations. SDM may generate alerts about the following configuration tasks:
SSH credentials not verified—Cisco SDM requires you to provide your SSH (cid:127)
credentials before beginning. NTP not configured—The router must have accurate time for certificate (cid:127)
enrollment to work. Identifying a Network Time Protocol server from which
your router can obtain accurate time provides a time source that is not

an NTP server, you may want to use a publicly available server, such as the
server described at the following URL:
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/clock2a.html
DNS not configured—Specifying DNS servers helps ensure that the router is (cid:127)
able to contact the certificate server. DNS configuration is required to contact
the CA server and any other server related to certificate enrollment such as
OCSP servers or CRL repositories if those servers are entered as names and
not as IP addresses. Domain and/or Hostname not configured—It is recommended that you (cid:127)
configure a domain and hostname before beginning enrollment. CA Server Wizard: Welcome
The Certificate Authority (CA) server wizard guides you through the
configuration of a CA server. Be sure to have the following information before
you begin:
General information about the CA server—The name that you intend to give (cid:127)
the server, the certificate issuer name that you want to use, and the username
and password that enrollees will be required to enter when sending an
enrollment request to the server. More detailed information about the server—Whether the server will operate (cid:127)
in Registration Authority (RA) mode or Certificate Authority (CA) mode, the
level of information about each certificate that the server will store, whether
the server should grant certificates automatically, and the lifetimes of the
certificates granted, and open enrollment requests. Supporting information—Links to the RA server that will store the (cid:127)
certificates and to the Certificate Revocation List Distribution Point (CDP)
server. CA Server Wizard: Certificate Authority Information

the host name of the router, or another name that you enter. Grant
Manual Auto Choose if you want to grant certificates manually. Choose if you
want the server to grant certificates automatically. Auto, used mostly for debug
purposes, is not recommended since it will issue certificates to any requester
without requiring enrollment information. Do not set Grant to Auto if your router is connected to the Internet. Grant should Warning
be set to Auto only for internal purposes such as when executing debugging
procedures. CDP URL
Enter the URL to a Certificate Revocation List Distribution Point (CDP) server in
the CDP URL field. The URL must be an HTTP URL. A sample URL follows:
http://172.18.108.26/cisco1cdp.cisco1.crl
The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is the list of revoked certificates. Devices
needing to check the validity of another device’s certificate will fetch the CRL
from the CA server. Since many devices may attempt to fetch the CRL, offloading
it to a remote device, preferably an HTTP server, will reduce the performance
impact on the Cisco IOS router hosting the CA server. If the checking device
cannot connect to the CDP, as a backup it will use SCEP to fetch the CRL from
the CA server. Issuer Name Attributes

The CA server uses public and private RSA keys to encrypt data and to sign
certificates. SDM automatically generates a new key pair and gives it the name of
the CA server. You can change the key modulus and type, and you can make the
key exportable. You must enter a passphrase to use when restoring the CA server. Label
This field is read-only. SDM uses the name of the CA server as the name of the

Enter the key modulus value. If you want a modulus value between 512 and 1024
enter an integer value that is a multiple of 64. If you want a value higher than
1024, you can enter 1536 or 2048. If you enter a value greater than 512, key
generation may take a minute or longer. The modulus determines the size of the key. The larger the modulus, the more
secure the key, but keys with large modulus take longer to generate, and
encryption/decryption operations take longer with larger keys. Type

Cisco IOS SSL VPN
Cisco IOS SSL VPN provides Secure Socket Layer (SSL) VPN remote-access
connectivity from almost any Internet-enabled location using only a web browser
and its native SSL encryption. This enables companies to extend their secure
enterprise networks to any authorized user by providing remote-access
connectivity to corporate resources from any Internet-enabled location. Cisco IOS SSL VPN also enables access from noncorporate-owned machines,
including home computers, Internet kiosks, and wireless hotspots, where an IT
department cannot easily deploy and manage the VPN client software necessary
for IPsec VPN connections. There are three modes of SSL VPN access: clientless, thin-client and full-tunnel
client. Cisco SDM supports all three. Each mode is described below:
Clientless SSL VPN—Clientless mode provides secure access to private web (cid:127)
resources and will provide access to web content. This mode is useful for
accessing most content that you would expect to use within a web browser,
such as intranet access, and online tools that employ a web interface. Thin Client SSL VPN (port-forwarding Java applet)—Thin Client mode (cid:127)
extends the capability of the cryptographic functions of the web browser to
enable remote access to TCP-based applications such as POP3, SMTP, IMAP,
Telnet, and SSH. Full Tunnel Client SSL VPN—Full tunnel client mode offers extensive (cid:127)
application support through its dynamically downloaded SSL VPN client
software for Cisco IOS SSL VPN. With the Full tunnel Client for Cisco IOS
SSL VPN, we delivers a lightweight, centrally configured and
easy-to-support SSL VPN tunneling client that allows network layer
connectivity access to virtually any application. Cisco Router and Security Device Manager 2.4 User’s Guide

A method list is a sequential list describing the authentication methods to be
queried in order to authenticate a user. Method lists enable you to designate one
or more security protocols to be used for authentication, thus ensuring a backup
system for authentication in case the initial method fails. Cisco IOS software uses the first listed method to authenticate users. If that
method fails to respond, the Cisco IOS software selects the next authentication
method listed in the method list. This process continues until there is successful
communication with a listed authentication method, or all methods defined in the
method list are exhausted. It is important to note that the Cisco IOS software attempts authentication with
the next listed authentication method only when there is no response from the
previous method. If authentication fails at any point in this cycle—meaning that
the security server or local username database responds by denying the user
access—the authentication process stops and no other authentication methods are
attempted. Name/Specify

SDP Troubleshooting Tips
Guidelines
When SDP is launched, you must minimize the browser window displaying (cid:127)
this help topic so that you can view the SDP web application. If you are planning to configure the router using SDP, you should do so (cid:127)
immediately after configuring your WAN connection. When you complete the configuration changes in SDP, you must return to (cid:127)
Cisco SDM and click Refresh on the toolbar to view the status of the
trustpoint in the Router Certificates window in the VPN Components tree. Troubleshooting Tips
These recommendations involve preparations on the local router and on the CA
server. You need to communicate these requirements to the administrator of the
CA server. Ensure the following:
The local router and the CA server have IP connectivity between each other. (cid:127)
The local router must be able to ping the certificate server successfully, and
the certificate server must be able to successfully ping the local router. The CA server administrator uses a web browser that supports JavaScript. (cid:127)
The CA server administrator has enable privileges on the local router. (cid:127)
The firewall on the local router will permit traffic to and from the certificate (cid:127)
server. If a firewall is configured on the Petitioner and/or on the Registrar, you must (cid:127)
ensure that the Firewall permits HTTP or HTTPS traffic from the PC from
which the Cisco SDM /SDP application is invoked. For more information about SDP, see the following web page:

Cisco Common Classification Policy
Language
Cisco Common Classification Policy Language (C3PL) is a structured
replacement for feature-specific configuration commands. C3PL allows you to
create traffic policies based on events, conditions, and actions. SDM uses C3PL
to create the policy maps and class maps that the following help topics describe. Policy Map
Policy maps specify the actions to be taken when traffic matches defined criteria. Traffic types and criteria are defined in class maps associated with a policy map. In order for a router to use the information in a policy map and its associated class
maps, the policy map must be associated with a zone-pair. See Zone-Based Policy
Firewall for more information on configuring zones and zone pairs. Policy Map Windows
Use the policy map windows to review, create and edit policy maps for QoS,
HTTP, and other types of traffic. The top portion of the window lists the
configured policy maps, and the bottom portion displays the details of the
highlighted policy map. If you need to edit a policy map or see more detail, click
Edit to display a dialog that lets you view information and make changes. This help topic provides a general description for the policy map windows and
some sample data. Cisco Router and Security Device Manager 2.4 User’s Guide

Authentication, Authorization, and
Accounting
Cisco IOS Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) is an
architectural framework for configuring a set of three independent security
functions in a consistent manner. AAA provides a modular way of performing
authentication, authorization, and accounting services.
Cisco IOS AAA provides the following benefits:
Increased flexibility and control (cid:127)
Scalability (cid:127)
Standardized authentication methods. Cisco SDM enables you to configure (cid:127)
the Remote Authentication Dialin User Service (RADIUS), and the Terminal
Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+) authentication
methods.
AAA Main Window
This window provides a summary view of the AAA configuration on the router.

Add or Edit a Method List for Authentication or Authorization
A method list is a sequential list describing the authentication methods to be
queried in order to authenticate a user. Method lists enable you to designate one
or more security protocols to be used for authentication, thus ensuring a backup
system for authentication in case the initial method fails.
Cisco IOS software uses the first listed method to authenticate users. If that
method fails to respond, the Cisco IOS software selects the next authentication
method listed in the method list. This process continues until there is successful
communication with a listed authentication method, or all methods defined in the
method list are exhausted.
It is important to note that the Cisco IOS software attempts authentication with
the next listed authentication method only when there is no response from the
previous method. If authentication fails at any point in this cycle—meaning that
the security server or local username database responds by denying the user
access—the authentication process stops and no other authentication methods are
attempted.
Name/Specify
Select the name Default in the Name list, or select User Defined, and enter a
method list name in the Specify field.

Methods
A method is a configured server group. Up to four methods can be specified and
placed in the list in the order you want the router to use them. The router will
attempt the first method in the list. If the authentication request receives a PASS

a response by using the first method, it uses the next method in the list, and
continues to the end of the list until it receives a PASS or a FAIL response.

A method list is a sequential list describing the authentication methods to be
queried in order to authenticate a user. Method lists enable you to designate one
or more security protocols to be used for authentication, thus ensuring a backup
system for authentication in case the initial method fails.
Cisco IOS software uses the first listed method to authenticate users. If that
method fails to respond, the Cisco IOS software selects the next authentication
method listed in the method list. This process continues until there is successful
communication with a listed authentication method, or all methods defined in the
method list are exhausted.
It is important to note that the Cisco IOS software attempts authentication with
the next listed authentication method only when there is no response from the
previous method. If authentication fails at any point in this cycle—meaning that
the security server or local username database responds by denying the user
access—the authentication process stops and no other authentication methods are
attempted.

Cisco IOS Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) is an
architectural framework for configuring a set of three independent security
functions in a consistent manner. AAA provides a modular way of performing
authentication, authorization, and accounting services.
Cisco IOS AAA provides the following benefits:
Increased flexibility and control (cid:127)
Scalability (cid:127)
Standardized authentication methods. Cisco SDM enables you to configure (cid:127)
the Remote Authentication Dialin User Service (RADIUS), and the Terminal

Add or Edit a Method List for Authentication or Authorization
A method list is a sequential list describing the authentication methods to be
queried in order to authenticate a user. Method lists enable you to designate one
or more security protocols to be used for authentication, thus ensuring a backup
system for authentication in case the initial method fails.
Cisco IOS software uses the first listed method to authenticate users. If that
method fails to respond, the Cisco IOS software selects the next authentication
method listed in the method list. This process continues until there is successful
communication with a listed authentication method, or all methods defined in the
method list are exhausted.
It is important to note that the Cisco IOS software attempts authentication with
the next listed authentication method only when there is no response from the
previous method. If authentication fails at any point in this cycle—meaning that
the security server or local username database responds by denying the user
access—the authentication process stops and no other authentication methods are
attempted.
Name/Specify
Select the name Default in the Name list, or select User Defined, and enter a

A method is a configured server group. Up to four methods can be specified and
placed in the list in the order you want the router to use them. The router will
attempt the first method in the list. If the authentication request receives a PASS
or a FAIL response, the router does not query further. If the router does not receive
a response by using the first method, it uses the next method in the list, and
continues to the end of the list until it receives a PASS or a FAIL response.

Authentication, Authorization, and
Accounting
Cisco IOS Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) is an
architectural framework for configuring a set of three independent security
functions in a consistent manner. AAA provides a modular way of performing
authentication, authorization, and accounting services.
Cisco IOS AAA provides the following benefits:
Increased flexibility and control (cid:127)
Scalability (cid:127)
Standardized authentication methods. Cisco SDM enables you to configure (cid:127)
the Remote Authentication Dialin User Service (RADIUS), and the Terminal
Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+) authentication
methods.
AAA Main Window
This window provides a summary view of the AAA configuration on the router.

A method list is a sequential list describing the authentication methods to be
queried in order to authenticate a user. Method lists enable you to designate one
or more security protocols to be used for authentication, thus ensuring a backup
system for authentication in case the initial method fails.
Cisco IOS software uses the first listed method to authenticate users. If that
method fails to respond, the Cisco IOS software selects the next authentication
method listed in the method list. This process continues until there is successful
communication with a listed authentication method, or all methods defined in the
method list are exhausted.
It is important to note that the Cisco IOS software attempts authentication with
the next listed authentication method only when there is no response from the
previous method. If authentication fails at any point in this cycle—meaning that
the security server or local username database responds by denying the user
access—the authentication process stops and no other authentication methods are
attempted.

a response by using the first method, it uses the next method in the list, and
continues to the end of the list until it receives a PASS or a FAIL response.

system for authentication in case the initial method fails.
Cisco IOS software uses the first listed method to authenticate users. If that
method fails to respond, the Cisco IOS software selects the next authentication
method listed in the method list. This process continues until there is successful
communication with a listed authentication method, or all methods defined in the
method list are exhausted.
It is important to note that the Cisco IOS software attempts authentication with
the next listed authentication method only when there is no response from the
previous method. If authentication fails at any point in this cycle—meaning that
the security server or local username database responds by denying the user
access—the authentication process stops and no other authentication methods are
attempted.
Name/Specify
Select the name Default in the Name list, or select User Defined, and enter a
method list name in the Specify field.

in Prerequisite Tasks for PKI Configurations.
Create Certificate Authority (CA) Server
Click this button to create a CA server on the router. Because only one CA server
can be configured on the router, this button is disabled if a CA server is already
configured.
The CA server you configure using SDM allows you to grant and revoke Note
certificates. Although the router does store the serial numbers and other
identifying information about the certificates that it grants, it does not store the
certificates themselves. The CA server should be configured with a URL to a
Registration Authority (RA) server that can store certificates that the CA server
grants.
Restore Certificate Authority (CA) Server
If a CA server already operates on the router, you can restore the CA server
configuration, and the information. If no CA server is configured on the router,
this option is disabled.
Prerequisite Tasks for PKI Configurations
Before you begin a certificate enrollment or CA server configuration, it may be
necessary for you to complete supporting configuration tasks first. SDM reviews
the running configuration before allowing you to begin, alerts you to
configurations you must complete, and provides links that take you to the areas of
SDM that allow you to complete these configurations.
SDM may generate alerts about the following configuration tasks:
SSH credentials not verified—Cisco SDM requires you to provide your SSH (cid:127)
credentials before beginning.

DNS not configured—Specifying DNS servers helps ensure that the router is (cid:127)
able to contact the certificate server. DNS configuration is required to contact
the CA server and any other server related to certificate enrollment such as
OCSP servers or CRL repositories if those servers are entered as names and
not as IP addresses.
Domain and/or Hostname not configured—It is recommended that you (cid:127)
configure a domain and hostname before beginning enrollment.
CA Server Wizard: Welcome
The Certificate Authority (CA) server wizard guides you through the

you begin:
General information about the CA server—The name that you intend to give (cid:127)
the server, the certificate issuer name that you want to use, and the username
and password that enrollees will be required to enter when sending an
enrollment request to the server.
More detailed information about the server—Whether the server will operate (cid:127)
in Registration Authority (RA) mode or Certificate Authority (CA) mode, the
level of information about each certificate that the server will store, whether
the server should grant certificates automatically, and the lifetimes of the
certificates granted, and open enrollment requests.

The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is the list of revoked certificates. Devices
needing to check the validity of another device’s certificate will fetch the CRL
from the CA server. Since many devices may attempt to fetch the CRL, offloading
it to a remote device, preferably an HTTP server, will reduce the performance

CA Server Wizard: RSA Keys
The CA server uses public and private RSA keys to encrypt data and to sign
certificates. SDM automatically generates a new key pair and gives it the name of
the CA server. You can change the key modulus and type, and you can make the
key exportable. You must enter a passphrase to use when restoring the CA server.
Label
This field is read-only. SDM uses the name of the CA server as the name of the
key pair.
Modulus
Enter the key modulus value. If you want a modulus value between 512 and 1024
enter an integer value that is a multiple of 64. If you want a value higher than
1024, you can enter 1536 or 2048. If you enter a value greater than 512, key
generation may take a minute or longer.
The modulus determines the size of the key. The larger the modulus, the more
secure the key, but keys with large modulus take longer to generate, and
encryption/decryption operations take longer with larger keys.
Type
By default, Cisco SDM creates a general purpose key pair that is used for both
encryption and signature. If you want Cisco SDM to generate separate key pairs
Usage Keys. for encrypting and signing documents, choose Cisco SDM will
generate usage keys for encryption and signature.
